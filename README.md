# Analysis-of-Predictive-Maintenance-dataset

- Aart from building a prediction ML model, a detailed data analysis is done to get insightful information
from the dataset. All stages of ML lifeâ€‘cycle (Feature engineering,
Feature selection, Model creation, hyparameter tuning & Cross Validation) is
performed on the dataset.

BACKGROUND:- A company has a fleet of devices transmitting daily
sensor readings. They would like to create a predictive maintenance
solution to proactively identify when maintenance should be
performed. This approach promises cost savings over routine or time based preventive maintenance, because tasks are performed only when
warranted. 
GOAL:- You are tasked with building a predictive model using machine
learning to predict the probability of a device failure. When building
this model, be sure to minimize false positives and false negatives. The
column you are trying to Predict is called failure with binary value 0 for
non-failure and 1 for failure.
